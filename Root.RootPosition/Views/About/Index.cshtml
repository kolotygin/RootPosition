A warm and loving teacher, she has helped many students make enormous progress in their playing and singing.  Ms. Kolotygin students range from 3 year old to senior and from beginner to advanced. Olga’s students are given an opportunity to perform in recitals held over the course of the year, where the whole family and friends can attend to enjoy the performances.</p>
            <p>If students wish, they may take exams offered by the Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM). The Royal Conservatory is a national testing board that is based in Toronto.

            <p>Any prospective student can book an appointment with Olga free of charge where she will evaluate his or her musical abilities and decide on a course of study. Weekly lessons would be scheduled accordingly.</p>
